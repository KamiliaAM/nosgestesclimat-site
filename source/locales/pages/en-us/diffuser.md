# Disseminate Our Climate Actions

Our Climate Gestures is a public service, its code [is
free](/documentation) and reusable by everyone.

However, you can take advantage of and distribute our simulator in
several ways without mobilizing development skills.

## You want to integrate the simulator directly on your website

Nothing could be easier! Integrate it into a blog post or site simply by
adding the line below to your web page.

`<script id="nosgestesclimat" src="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/iframe.js"></script>`

Join [the many current
reusers](https://datagir.ademe.fr/apps/nos-gestes-climat/) in this way.

The module will automatically stay up to date with the [latest
developments](/nouveaut√©s).

To learn more about integration, visit [our
guide](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/PERSONNALISATION.md).

## You host climate conferences

To spice up a conference and make your listeners active on their phones,
what could be better than letting them do a live simulation?

You want to estimate the climate footprint of a group of people, or
simply integrate the simulator and retrieve the simulation result in the
user's account?

The "conference" and "survey" features are now available!

Go to [üèüÔ∏è group mode](/groupe) on choose a room name, share the link,
and launch the simulation match!

## <span role="img" aria-label="" aria-hidden="true">üá¨üáß</span> You want the same calculator tailored to your country

We are looking for native partners to translate and adapt the GHG
emissions model for the specificities of other countries.

> We are actively looking for foreign partners to decline Our Climate

## You want to customize the tool for your own needs

To learn more about custom integration<span lang="en">(</span>

customization
guide](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/PERSONNALISATION.md).

## You just want to help us

Contributions are free. We are looking for :

-   people who like to juggle physical units and model calculations by
    finding the best available data sources
-   developers and designers to improve the site, its design and its
    features

Everything is on
[Github](https://github.com/datagir/?q=nosgestesclimat&type=&language=&sort=),
