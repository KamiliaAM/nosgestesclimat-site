## The reference simulator

With **soon [one million tests completed](/stats)**, nosgestesclimat.fr is the reference personal carbon footprint calculator.

## What is the climate footprint?

The climate is warming up because of human activities, that's a fact. But what is our role in all this as citizens?

To estimate our own impact on global warming, it is customary to calculate _the individual carbon footprint of consumption_.

The principle is simple: for each consumption (taking your car for 10km, eating a steak, heating your house with gas...), we count the greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle.

As you go along, the weight of each sector (transport, food, housing...) is added to make up your personal carbon footprint, which can be viewed on three infographics.

## Act on my footprint, right now

After a 10-minute test, the [action path](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/actions/liste) allows you to prioritize the eco-gestures to reduce your footprint by distinguishing between small gestures for the climate (replacing our light bulbs, turning off our appliances on standby), and large gestures (eating less meat, electrifying our uses...) which have a significant impact.

Of course, even if it is essential to measure the footprint of a consumption and to understand its magnitude in relation to the [climate budget] (https://datagir.ademe.fr/blog/budget-empreinte-carbone-c-est-quoi/), it often happens that it is not completely within our personal control: for example, I am a tenant in a tense area and my landlord refuses to insulate my apartment.
