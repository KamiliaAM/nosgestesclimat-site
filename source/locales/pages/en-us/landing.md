## The reference simulator

With **almost [a million tests completed](/stats)**, nosgestesclimat.fr
is the reference personal carbon footprint calculator.

## What is my climate footprint?

The climate is warming up because of human activities, that's a fact.
But what is our role in all this as citizens?

To estimate our own impact on global warming, it is usual to calculate
_our personal consumption carbon footprint_.

The principle is simple: for each consumption (taking your car for 10km,
eating a steak, heating your house with gas...), we count the greenhouse
gas emissions over its life cycle.

As you go along, the weight of each sector (transport, food, housing,
etc.) is added to make up your personal carbon footprint, and then explained visually with three infographics.

## Acting on my footprint, right now

After a 10-minute test, the [action
pages](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/actions/liste) allow you to prioritize
the means to reduce your footprint and distinguish
the actions with the least impact on the climate (replacing our light bulbs, turning off
our appliances on standby) from the most impactful ones (eating less meat,
electrifying our lifestyle...).

Of course, though it is essential to measure the footprint of our
consumptions and to understand their magnitude in relation to the [climate
budget](https://datagir.ademe.fr/blog/budget-empreinte-carbone-c-est-quoi/),
it often happens that some are not completely within our personal control:
for example, if one doesn't own the flat he lives in an the landlord refuses to reduce its energy consumption through insulation.
