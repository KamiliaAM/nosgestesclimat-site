This is part of\nour strategy to open up to audiences not yet aware of these topics.\n\n[The Ministry of the Environment is demoing this\nhere](https://twitter.com/i/status/1488059482647236608).\n\n## Seasonal, local food üåª üöõ\n\nFrom Agribalyse, we have developed climate footprint variation models\ncorresponding to seasonal and local diets.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/140048614-299fc659-6c87-441c-ab91-4b79e7c44b11.gif)\n\nTo our knowledge, these improvements are groundbreaking work! You will\nsee that these \"options\" have little influence if your diet is not\nalready strongly vegetarian.\n\n## New screen to help you enter mileage while driving ‚å®Ô∏è üõ£Ô∏è\n\nYou may have noticed that it's hard to answer the question \"How many\nmiles do you drive each year?\" all at once.\n\nSo have we: so we've designed a form to help with that entry.\n\n![Aide √† la saisie km voiture -\nd√©mo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151338682-c79c82d3-4582-4981-98ab-401dc8c81206.gif)\n\nBig bonus: this form also avoids estimating a vehicle fill rate, which\nis usually a very risky task.\n\n## Improvements to the \"action\" path üéØ\n\n-   two new actions to switch to seasonal and local food\n-   we improved the action to reduce the temperature of the home: we now\n    ask you your current temperature\n-   a new action to go vegan\n-   we separated the actions into different ranges, from \"more than a\n    ton\" to \"less than 10kg\", and finally to \"unquantified actions\".\n\n## Gas prices üî•\n\nYou will surely have seen it: gas prices are exploding in France.\nBetween +40% and +110% in a few months. So we have revised upwards our\ntool to help estimate kWh from ‚Ç¨/month.\n\nTo do so, we have reimplemented the gas bill at the regulated rate,\nincluding the various taxes and subscriptions that modify this figure.\n\n## New profile page\n\nA small button appears on the home page, it indicates that you already\nhave data on nosgestesclimat.fr. As before, we have no data on our\nservers, everything is local on your browser.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852468-1e9d0cf1-a19e-4540-8c9a-2bf9beb0c6da.png)\n\nAbove all, the profile page has a new look, it is now much easier to\nnavigate through your answers.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852657-f06c1d34-fc05-4c4a-8d23-8304cacfc4ea.png)\n\n## Ecodesign üèãÔ∏è\n\n*Let's keep in mind that the footprint of the service and use of a\nwebsite in France is very small and already in general naturally\noptimized by developers. The environmental impact of digital is mainly\nrelated to manufacturing [(70% for example for a\nsmartphone)](https://librairie.ademe.fr/cadic/5311/infographie-preferer-smartphone-reconditionne.pdf?modal=false).*\n\n### Small screens\n\nWe continue to work to support small screens.\n\nHere are the improvements on iPhone5 SE.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875622-2991b5a6-69c9-4c04-9422-48c727cc81af.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875673-c96e2098-22bb-4e71-b993-3c121fd008a6.png)\n\nTo do this, we have optimized the footprint distribution graph,\nintegrating the texts in the bars. It has also been animated, which\nmakes it much easier to understand the impact of choices in the input.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852263-5fb7fe31-e13e-4ce5-96a8-4794d19f5ce7.png)\n\n### Hosting the site\n\nWe [asked](https://answers.netlify.com/t/low-carbon-european-cdn/48784)\nour host (Netlify), if it would be possible for them to implement a\nserver in France so that our users can see their site served from\nFrance, rather than from Germany currently.\n\n## Coming in 2022\n\nSee our roadmap for the calculation model\n[here](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/projects/1).\n",

This mode\n    can be particularly interesting in the context of a workshop or an\n    event, a [facilitator\n    guide](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/guide) is available to help\n    you!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632300-dba6d437-a9bd-44b3-afc3-874c1e7307d6.png)\n\n-   **The** arrival of this new mode is accompanied by an additional\n    feature that allows you to add a few questions to collect additional\n    information as an introduction to the test. For example, this can be\n    useful to organize a survey at the scale of an organization while\n    allowing to filter the results by type of respondent (status...),\n    age, place of living (while taking care not to compromise the\n    standards of RGPD). We have also worked on the security of the\n    surveys to avoid the introduction of vulnerabilities in our database\n    via this feature. You can find all the info in our\n    [documentation](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/documentation-contexte)!\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632420-ada9f5c5-b1ab-45a5-b0f7-05d95df2b3bc.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" />\n\n-   In the previous version, any user who logged in to the survey\n    appeared in the**visualization** graph. Some people counted as 1\n    participant without even having taken the test (with a score\n    corresponding to the default values) and the ghost visits distorted\n    the results (especially the average value!). This is no longer the\n    case in this version since the data displayed is filtered by\n    excluding users who completed less than 10% of the test questions.\n    In case the survey is customized (see above), an additional filter\n    is applied to display only the participants who completed the\n    context questions.\n\n## A new metric: oil! üõ¢\n\nTo better visualize the amount of oil we consume in our lives, we\ndecided to add to Our Climate Gestures the number of corresponding full\ntanks, in addition to the CO‚ÇÇe. For the moment, this metric is reported\nonly on direct oil-related emissions (travel, oil heating ...). The way\nto both highlight our dependence on these fossil fuels but also to\nbetter visualize the impact of actions we can put in place: the number\nof trips to the pump speaks more than tons of CO‚ÇÇe, so swipe on the end\nscreen to see your oil impact!\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171646402-b2d769d1-0626-4a0d-8903-90b7727383e0.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"577\" />\n\n## Improvements to the calculation model üßÆ\n\n-   **Added caravan & motorhome** There are now more choices in Our\n    Climate Gestures for going on vacation! Caravans and motor homes\n    have found their place. Attention, for the caravan, the number of\n    kilometers traveled is well to include in the kilometers traveled by\n    car. More information on the methodology in issue \\#1317\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/160854704-aa5b1010-e8f9-43cb-966b-ba80e6a8f731.png)\n\n-   **Change in passenger ratio** With the arrival of the assistance for\n    entering the kilometers in [the last\n    release](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut%C3%A9s/las-n%C3%A9ous),\n    a question remained about the choice of the vehicle's filling rate\n    applied to attribute the depreciation to the different users of the\n    car. The details are available in issue \\#1337 and in the [note of\n    the variable \"passenger\n    ratio\"](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/blob/8fe4b633502fe52dda7eccdc0e9db01b9f677e57/data/transport/transport%20.%20voiture.yaml#L53).\n\n-   **More choice of fuels** Diesel (B7 or B10), gasoline (E5 or E10) or\n    E85 gasoline (biofuels), you can choose! However, beware of the\n    message sent to the user when he selects biofuels. The carbon impact\n    is certainly lower, but the emission factor is particularly\n    uncertain: the issues related to land use are not taken into\n    account! A notification is therefore displayed to explain this\n    issue! All the info and discussions are in the corresponding issue\n    \\#1396!\n\n-   **Improvement of the digital mosaic** New objects have been added\n    for the digital objects mosaic \\#1359 :\n    -   üéµ bluetooth speaker\n    -   üîä voice speaker\n    -   ‚åöÔ∏è connected watch\n    -   üïπ living room console\n    -   üéÆ portable console\n-   **New heating modes** It is now possible to choose the heat pump\n    (\\#1360)!

We will continue to improve the other\nentries soon (wood in pellets, fuel oil).\n\n## Other improvements\n\nNew features (like this one you are reading) now appear directly on\nhttps://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut√©s, it's still more accessible than\n[on github](https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/releases) üôÇ\n\nüêõ Several quite important bugs have been solved thanks to your feedback\n(end of simulation always at 11 tons, default value input -&gt; no\n\"next\" button, etc.)\n\n## Our roadmap\n\nNow that the \"issues\" onget is clearer, it was time to put online our\nroadmap on the simulator / calculation model side, it is in the\n[\"Projects\"\nsection](https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/projects/1).

We've redesigned it entirely, bringing it closer to a mini-game\nwhere the goal is to reduce your footprint.\n\n![ngc-action-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139829768-5759d428-1e0d-4c7d-9fd3-682dbebb1b90.gif)\n\nThis is just the beginning: we have already planned the [next\nsteps](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/359) to\nmake engagement even easier.\n\nWe're also introducing *personas*: typical profiles you can select to\nexperience the action journey as a given citizen.\n\n## The menu üêüÔ∏è\n\nWe've received dozens of requests to integrate a fish menu on the diet\nchoice screen.

Many new features on\nfood will follow.\n\n## A new menu for the application\n\nNosgestesclimat is designed to be used on mobile as on desktop. The\nmobile version now has a permanent menu at the bottom of the screen, and\nthe desktop version has a new arrangement in two columns, with a menu\nalso present on the left.\n\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02\n11-31-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830463-203c8896-0eda-49ad-ba45-be1a19e180de.png)\n\nThis new menu makes the application more accessible, and it's just one\nof many accessibility improvements we have\n[planned](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/350).\n\n## The French average is now 9 tons!\n\nUnfortunately, this does not reflect unexpected efforts, but an\nimprovement of the calculation method of the Ministry of the\nEnvironment.\n\nThe good news is that the French administration is taking the issue\nseriously, improving its calculations and explaining the differences in\na scientific way.\n\nDetailed explanations\n[here](https://twitter.com/maeool/status/1453282887583866885).\n\nSo why do we show an average of 9.8 tons in the simulator? Because our\ncalculation is made using another method than the government one,\ncomplementary. More info\n[here](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/365#issuecomment-957321261).\n\n## Conference mode improvements üèüÔ∏è\n\nThis collective mode of using ourclimategests is more and more used. To\nfacilitate the sharing of the link at the beginning of the conference,\nwe generate a super QRCode that you just have to project or send by\nemail ![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02\n11-32-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830597-63fe1856-5622-4c52-b7f4-23ccbfaa6bd9.png).\n\nAnother improvement is that we exclude from the group's results\nsimulations that have resulted in a footprint that is too high, above\n100 tons. This limit will be configurable soon.\n\n## Technical improvements üêá\n\nWe continue to lighten the site, removing a graphic animation library\n(react-spring) and better cutting the conference mode from the rest of\nthe application.\n\nOf course, many reported bugs have also been fixed.\n",

We hope to improve the diffusion of the\napplication. Below is a Whatsapp capture.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/112972961-1d9ae100-9151-11eb-9f34-bc3061ca35da.png)\n\nSee [this PR](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/208).\n\n\\#\\# Introduction of personas\n\nThis system, to be populated with profiles if possible representative of\nthe population, will allow us to better test and develop the\napplication.\n\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-03-29\n15-50-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/112846716-a14bc380-90a6-11eb-8060-219bed3d3ddf.png)\n\n## Bug fixes\n\nWe corrected a big bug: the \"previous\" button of the simulation was\nbadly done. We removed it, fixed the same problem that affected the \"my\nanswers\" button, which now becomes the only way to modify your answers.\nIt has been widely promoted.\n",
