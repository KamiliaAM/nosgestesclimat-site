We now divide it by the number of inhabitants of the dwelling \r\n\r\n## Launching the conference mode in the foreground\r\n\r\nThe feature is now open to everyone, on the home page \r\n\r\nIt allows friends, colleagues and workgroups to interactively calculate their footprint together.\r\n\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-06-14 17-10-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/121915284-5ea79800-cd33-11eb-8530-fe334eef9cd7.png)\r\n\r\nA new guide allows you to understand the principle before getting started.\r\n\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-06-14 17-11-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/121915462-8434a180-cd33-11eb-850f-9b7fd909639b.png)\r\n\r\nRoom names in French are automatically generated to avoid having to worry about finding a name.\r\n\r\nOther bugs in the /conference mode have been fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We've redesigned it entirely, making it more like a mini-game where the goal is to reduce your footprint \r\n\r\n![ngc-action-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139829768-5759d428-1e0d-4c7d-9fd3-682dbebb1b90.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is just the beginning - we already have [next steps](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/359) planned to make it even easier to engage.\r\n\r\nWe are also introducing *personas*: typical profiles that you can select to experience the action path as a given citizen \r\n\r\n## Menu üêüÔ∏è\r\n\r\nWe've received dozens of requests to include a fish menu on the diet choice screen. There are now 2 of them! \r\n\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02 11-29-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830102-bd7cee54-c1fd-454c-8eb0-7ce2a750ffa8.png)\r\n\r\nThese new dishes have been made from the [Agribalyse] database (https://agribalyse.fr/), and the calculation is of course *open*. A lot of news about food will follow \r\n\r\n## A new menu for the application \r\n\r\nNosgestesclimat is designed to be used on mobile as on desktop. The mobile version now has a permanent menu at the bottom of the screen, and the desktop version of a new arrangement in two columns, with a menu also present on the left \r\n\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02 11-31-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830463-203c8896-0eda-49ad-ba45-be1a19e180de.png)\r\n\r\nThis new menu makes the application more accessible, and it's just one of many accessibility improvements we have [planned](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/350).\r\n\r\n## The French average is now 9 tons! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this does not reflect unexpected efforts, but an improvement in the calculation method of the Ministry of the Environment \r\n\r\nThe good news is that the French administration is taking the subject seriously, improving its calculations and explaining the differences in a scientific way \r\n\r\nDetailed explanations [here](https://twitter.com/maeool/status/1453282887583866885).\r\n\r\nSo why do we show an average of 9.8 tons in the simulator? Because our calculation is made using another method than the government one, complementary. More information [here](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/365#issuecomment-957321261).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conference mode improvements üèüÔ∏è\r\n\r\nThis collective mode of using ourgestesclimate is more and more used. To facilitate the sharing of the link at the beginning of the conference, we generate a great QRCode that you just have to project or send by mail\r\n![Capture d‚Äô√©cran du 2021-11-02 11-32-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830597-63fe1856-5622-4c52-b7f4-23ccbfaa6bd9.png) \r\n\r\nAnother improvement, we exclude from the group results the simulations that resulted in a too high footprint, above 100 tons. This limit will be configurable soon \r\n\r\n## Technical improvements üêá\r\n\r\nWe continue to make the site lighter, removing a graphic animation library (react-spring) and better cutting out the conference mode from the rest of the application \r\n\r\nOf course, many reported bugs have also been fixed.",

This is part of our strategy to reach out to audiences not yet aware of these topics.\r\n\r\n[The Ministry of the Environment demos it here](https://twitter.com/i/status/1488059482647236608) \r\n\r\n## Seasonal, local food üåª üöõ\r\n\r\nWe developed climate footprint variation models from Agribalyse corresponding to seasonal and local diets \r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/140048614-299fc659-6c87-441c-ab91-4b79e7c44b11.gif)\r\n\r\nThese improvements are, to our knowledge, an unprecedented work! You will see that these \"options\" have little influence if your diet is not already strongly vegetarian \r\n\r\n## New screen to help with mileage entry while driving ‚å®Ô∏è üõ£Ô∏è\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that it is difficult to answer the question \"How many miles do you drive each year?\" all at once \r\n\r\nSo have we: so we've designed a form to help with that entry \r\n\r\nhelp to enter car km - demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151338682-c79c82d3-4582-4981-98ab-401dc8c81206.gif)\r\n\r\nBig bonus: this form also avoids estimating a vehicle fill rate, which is usually a very risky task \r\n\r\n## Improvements of the \"action\" course üéØ\r\n\r\n- two new actions to switch to seasonal and local food\r\n- we improved the action to reduce housing temperature: we now ask for your current temperature\r\n- a new action to go vegan\r\n- we separated the actions into different ranges, from \"more than a ton\" to \"less than 10kg\", and finally to \"unquantified actions\" \r\n\r\n## Gas price üî•\r\n\r\nYou will surely have seen it: gas prices are exploding in France. Between +40% and +110% in a few months. So we have revised upwards our tool to help estimate kWh from ‚Ç¨/month \r\n\r\nTo do so, we have reimplemented the gas bill at the regulated rate, including the various taxes and subscriptions that modify this figure.\r\n\r\n## New profile page\r\n\r\nA small button appears on the home page, it indicates that you already have data on nosgestesclimat.fr. As before, we have no data on our servers, everything is local on your browser \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852468-1e9d0cf1-a19e-4540-8c9a-2bf9beb0c6da.png)\r\n\r\nAbove all, the profile page has been revamped, it is now much easier to navigate through your answers \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852657-f06c1d34-fc05-4c4a-8d23-8304cacfc4ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ecodesign üèãÔ∏è\r\n\r\n*Let's keep in mind that the footprint of the service and use of a website in France is very small and already in general naturally optimized by developers. The environmental impact of digital is mainly related to manufacturing [(70% e.g. for a smartphone)](https://librairie.ademe.fr/cadic/5311/infographie-preferer-smartphone-reconditionne.pdf?modal=false).*\r\n\r\n### Small screens \r\n\r\nWe continue to work to support small screens \r\n\r\nHere are the improvements on iPhone5 SE \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875622-2991b5a6-69c9-4c04-9422-48c727cc81af.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875673-c96e2098-22bb-4e71-b993-3c121fd008a6.png)\r\n\r\nTo do this, we have optimized the footprint distribution graph, by integrating the texts in the bars. It has also been animated, which makes it much easier to understand the impact of choices in the input \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852263-5fb7fe31-e13e-4ce5-96a8-4794d19f5ce7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Site hosting\r\n\r\nWe have [asked](https://answers.netlify.com/t/low-carbon-european-cdn/48784) our host (Netlify), if it would be possible for them to implement a server in France so that our users can see their site served from France, rather than from Germany currently \r\n\r\n## Coming in 2022\r\n\r\nSee our roadmap for the calculation model [here](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/projects/1) \r\n\r\n\r\n",

This mode can be particularly interesting in the context of a workshop or an event, a [facilitator's guide] (https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/guide) is available to help you!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632300-dba6d437-a9bd-44b3-afc3-874c1e7307d6.png)\r\n\r\n* **Survey customization*** The arrival of this new mode is a big step forward\r\nWith the arrival of this new mode comes an additional feature that allows you to add a few questions to gather additional information as an introduction to the test. For example, this can be useful to organize a survey at the scale of an organization while allowing to filter the results by type of respondent (status...), age, place of living (while taking care of course not to compromise the standards of RGPD). We also worked on the security of the surveys to avoid the introduction of vulnerabilities in our database via this feature. You will find all the info in our [documentation](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/documentation-contexte) !\r\n\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632420-ada9f5c5-b1ab-45a5-b0f7-05d95df2b3bc.png\">\r\n\r\n* **The group mode view page is better filtered\r\nIn the previous version, any user who logged in to the survey appeared in the visualization graph. Some people counted as 1 participant without even having taken the test (with a score corresponding to the default values) and the ghost visits distorted the results (especially the average value!). This is no longer the case in this version since the data displayed is filtered by excluding users who completed less than 10% of the test questions. In case the survey is customized (see above), an additional filter is applied to display only participants who have completed the context questions.\r\n\r\n## A new metric: oil! üõ¢\r\nTo better visualize the amount of oil we consume in our lives, we decided to add to Our Climate Gestures the corresponding number of full tanks, in addition to the CO‚ÇÇe. For the moment, this metric is reported only on direct oil-related emissions (travel, oil heating ...) \r\nThe way to both highlight our dependence on these fossil fuels but also to better visualize the impact of actions we can put in place: the number of passages at the pump speaks more than the tons of CO‚ÇÇe, so swipe on the end screen to see your oil impact!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"577\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171646402-b2d769d1-0626-4a0d-8903-90b7727383e0.png\">\r\n\r\n## Calculation model improvements üßÆ\r\n* **Added caravan &amp; motorhome**\r\nThere are now more choices in Our Climate Gestures for going on vacation! Caravans and motor homes have found their place. Please note that for caravans, the number of kilometers traveled is to be included in the kilometers traveled by car. More information on the methodology in issue #1317.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/160854704-aa5b1010-e8f9-43cb-966b-ba80e6a8f731.png)\r\n\r\n* **Change in passenger ratio\r\nWith the arrival of the km input help in [the last release](https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut%C3%A9s/las-n%C3%A9ous), a question remained as to the choice of the vehicle fill rate applied to attribute the depreciation to the different users of the car. A reflection was made to finally change the ratio initially chosen, details are available in issue #1337 and in the [note of the variable \"passenger ratio\"](https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/blob/8fe4b633502fe52dda7eccdc0e9db01b9f677e57/data/transport/transport%20.%20voiture.yaml#L53) \r\n\r\n* **More fuel choices\r\nDiesel (B7 or B10), gasoline (E5 or E10) or E85 gasoline (biofuels), you can choose! However, beware of the message sent to the user when selecting biofuels. The carbon impact is certainly lower, but the emission factor is particularly uncertain: the issues related to land use are not taken into account! A notification is therefore displayed to explain this issue! All the info and discussions are in the corresponding issue #1396!\r\n\r\n* **Improvement of the digital mosaic\r\nNew objects have been added for the digital mosaic #1359 :\r\n  - üéµ bluetooth speaker\r\n  -  üîä voice speaker\r\n  - ‚åöÔ∏è connected watch\r\n  - üïπ living room console\r\n  - üéÆ portable console\r\n \r\n* **New heating modes**\r\nHeat pump (#1360) can now be selected! Thoughts are underway to add heat networks as well.\r\n\r\n## Improvements in actions üí™\r\n* **A \"Buy an electric car\" action is making its appearance** \r\nProposed in case you already own a car, this action allows users to realize the impact (positive or negative) of buying a new or used electric car according to the kilometers driven per year.\r\n<img width=\"601\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171641150-ec39e53c-2565-43ae-8379-1b97691c8f03.png\">\r\n\r\n* **Addition of mesaidesvelo.fr in the actions\r\nAdd a link to [mesaidesvelo.fr](https://mesaidesvelo.fr/) in the relevant actions.
