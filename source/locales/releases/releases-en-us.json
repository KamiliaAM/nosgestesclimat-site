This is what makes it particularly robust to evolutions, because we don't painstakingly order questions by hand, and we don't recode entanglements like \"if the user said he lives in an apartment, then don't ask him about the lawnmower\": everything is handled for us \r\n\r\nThe management of \"mosaic\" questions (the \"heating\" checkboxes or the choice of lunch and dinner menus) has been improved, and now resides directly in <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/docs/mosaic.md\">the model</a>, alongside the other questions! \r\n\r\nWhat's the point? This allows contributors who don't want to bother with Javascript (and other coder considerations) to modify the questions in a very easy to access language ",

Ouch. That's corrected \r\n\r\n -  age of the house -> whether or not a footprint is taken into account, the houses > 50 years old are now at zero\r\n -  declination house vs apartment\r\n -  declination traditional construction (concrete I think) vs eco-built\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/994\r\n\r\n## Lots of new gestures to take action :boxing_glove \r\n\r\nWhich brings us to a good 20!\r\n\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-04-27 17-51-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/116272451-32cf5380-a781-11eb-8601-0e6ac7e83f9e.png)\r\n\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-04-27 17-51-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/116272430-2d720900-a781-11eb-9786-e09c5f5e8fcc.png)\r\n\r\nBut also \r\n- switch to LEDs at home\r\n- go without the car for trips &lt; 5km\r\n- give up the tumble dryer\r\n- replace my gas boiler by oil\r\n\r\nAfter a last salvo, we will move on to improving the UX of this \"climate gestures\" part.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A \"conference\" mode in preparation\r\n\r\nOn the PR number <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/222\">222</a>, you can follow the progress of a brand new simulation mode for our climate gestures : make the simulation with several people ! \r\n\r\nIt will be useful for conferences, for workshops, but also to simply test with friends.\r\n\r\nTo test it, <a href=\"https://conf--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/conférence\">it is here 🏹 🏹</a>\r\n\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-04-27 17-59-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/116273752-5515a100-a782-11eb-8483-c378c2c7406e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bonus : obsolescence of computer equipment\r\n\r\nWe have at heart to fight against the digital footprint by not neglecting the devices that have a lower definition than the current standard.

This is part of our strategy to reach out to audiences not yet aware of these topics.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/status/1488059482647236608\">The Ministry of the Environment has a demo of it here</a> \r\n\r\n## Seasonal, local food 🌻 🚛\r\n\r\nWe developed climate footprint variation models from Agribalyse corresponding to seasonal and local diets \r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/140048614-299fc659-6c87-441c-ab91-4b79e7c44b11.gif)\r\n\r\nThese improvements are, to our knowledge, an unprecedented work! You will see that these \"options\" have little influence if your diet is not already strongly vegetarian \r\n\r\n## New screen to help with mileage entry while driving ⌨️ 🛣️\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that it is difficult to answer the question \"How many miles do you drive each year?\" all at once \r\n\r\nSo have we: so we've designed a form to help with that entry \r\n\r\nhelp to enter car km - demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151338682-c79c82d3-4582-4981-98ab-401dc8c81206.gif)\r\n\r\nBig bonus: this form also avoids estimating a vehicle fill rate, which is usually a very risky task \r\n\r\n## Improvements of the \"action\" course 🎯\r\n\r\n- two new actions to switch to seasonal and local food\r\n- we improved the action to reduce housing temperature: we now ask for your current temperature\r\n- a new action to go vegan\r\n- we separated the actions into different ranges, from \"more than a ton\" to \"less than 10kg\", and finally to \"unquantified actions\" \r\n\r\n## Gas price 🔥\r\n\r\nYou will surely have seen it: gas prices are exploding in France. Between +40% and +110% in a few months. So we have revised upwards our tool to help estimate kWh from €/month \r\n\r\nTo do so, we have reimplemented the gas bill at the regulated rate, including the various taxes and subscriptions that modify this figure.\r\n\r\n## New profile page\r\n\r\nA small button appears on the home page, it indicates that you already have data on nosgestesclimat.fr. As before, we have no data on our servers, everything is local on your browser \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852468-1e9d0cf1-a19e-4540-8c9a-2bf9beb0c6da.png)\r\n\r\nAbove all, the profile page has a new look, it is now much easier to navigate through your answers \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852657-f06c1d34-fc05-4c4a-8d23-8304cacfc4ea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ecodesign 🏋️\r\n\r\n*Let's keep in mind that the footprint of the service and use of a website in France is very small and already in general naturally optimized by developers. The environmental impact of digital is mainly related to manufacturing <a href=\"https://librairie.ademe.fr/cadic/5311/infographie-preferer-smartphone-reconditionne.pdf?modal=false\">(70% for example for a smartphone)</a>.*\r\n\r\n### Small screens \r\n\r\nWe continue to work to support small screens \r\n\r\nHere are the improvements on iPhone5 SE \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875622-2991b5a6-69c9-4c04-9422-48c727cc81af.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/144875673-c96e2098-22bb-4e71-b993-3c121fd008a6.png)\r\n\r\nTo do this, we have optimized the footprint distribution graph, by integrating the texts in the bars. It has also been animated, which makes it much easier to understand the impact of choices in the input \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/151852263-5fb7fe31-e13e-4ce5-96a8-4794d19f5ce7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Site hosting\r\n\r\nWe have <a href=\"https://answers.netlify.com/t/low-carbon-european-cdn/48784\">asked</a> our host (Netlify), if it would be possible for them to implement a server in France so that our users can see their site served from France, rather than from Germany currently \r\n\r\n## Coming in 2022\r\n\r\nSee our roadmap for the calculation model <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/projects/1\">here</a> \r\n\r\n\r\n",

This mode can be particularly interesting in the context of a workshop or an event, a <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/guide\">facilitator guide</a> is available to help you!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632300-dba6d437-a9bd-44b3-afc3-874c1e7307d6.png)\r\n\r\n* **Survey customization\r\nThe arrival of this new mode is accompanied by an additional feature that allows you to add a few questions to collect additional information as an introduction to the test. For example, this can be useful to organize a survey at the scale of an organization while allowing to filter the results by type of respondent (status...), age, place of living (while taking care of course not to compromise the standards of RGPD). We have also worked on the security of the surveys to avoid the introduction of vulnerabilities in our database via this feature. You will find all the info in our <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/groupe/documentation-contexte\">documentation</a>!\r\n\r<img width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171632420-ada9f5c5-b1ab-45a5-b0f7-05d95df2b3bc.png\">\n\r\n\r\n* **The group mode view page is better filtered\r\nIn the previous version, any user who logged in to the survey appeared in the view graph. Some people counted as 1 participant without even having taken the test (with a score corresponding to the default values) and the ghost visits distorted the results (especially the average value!). This is no longer the case in this version since the data displayed is filtered by excluding users who completed less than 10% of the test questions. In case the survey is customized (see above), an additional filter is applied to display only the participants who completed the context questions.\r\n\r\n## A new metric: oil! 🛢\r\nTo better visualize the amount of oil we consume in our lives, we decided to add to Nos Gestes Climat the corresponding number of full tanks, in addition to the CO₂e. For the moment, this metric is reported only on direct emissions related to oil (travel, oil heating ...) \r\nThe way to both highlight our dependence on these fossil fuels but also to better visualize the impact of actions we can put in place: the number of passages at the pump speaks more than the tons of CO₂e, so swipe on the end screen to see your oil impact!\r\n\r<img width=\"577\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171646402-b2d769d1-0626-4a0d-8903-90b7727383e0.png\">\n\r\n\r\n## Calculation model improvements 🧮\r\n* **Added caravan & motorhome**\r\nThere are now more choices in Nos Gestes Climat to go on vacation! Caravans and motor homes have found their place. Please note that for caravans, the number of kilometers traveled is to be included in the kilometers traveled by car. More information on the methodology in issue #1317.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/160854704-aa5b1010-e8f9-43cb-966b-ba80e6a8f731.png)\r\n\r\n* **Change in passenger ratio\r\nWith the arrival of the km input help in <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut%C3%A9s/las-n%C3%A9ous\">the last release</a>, a question remained about the choice of the vehicle fill rate applied to attribute the depreciation to the different users of the car. The details are available in issue #1337 and in the <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/blob/8fe4b633502fe52dda7eccdc0e9db01b9f677e57/data/transport/transport%20.%20voiture.yaml#L53\">note of the \"passenger ratio\" variable</a> \r\n\r\n* **More fuel choices\r\nDiesel (B7 or B10), gasoline (E5 or E10) or E85 gasoline (biofuels), you can choose! Be careful, however, about the message sent to the user when he or she selects biofuels. The carbon impact is certainly lower, but the emission factor is particularly uncertain: the issues related to land use are not taken into account! A notification is therefore displayed to explain this issue! All the info and discussions are in the corresponding issue #1396!\r\n\r\n* **Improvement of the digital mosaic\r\nNew objects have been added for the digital mosaic #1359 :\r\n  - 🎵 bluetooth speaker\r\n  -  🔊 voice speaker\r\n  - ⌚️ connected watch\r\n  - 🕹 living room console\r\n  - 🎮 portable console\r\n \r\n* **New heating modes**\r\nHeat pump (#1360) can now be selected! Thoughts are underway to add heat networks as well.\r\n\r\n## Improvements in actions 💪\r\n* **A \"Buy an electric car\" action is making its appearance** \r\nProposed in case you already own a car, this action allows users to realize the impact (positive or negative) of buying a new or used electric car according to the kilometers driven per year.\r<img width=\"601\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55186402/171641150-ec39e53c-2565-43ae-8379-1b97691c8f03.png\">\n\r\n\r\n* **Addition of mesaidesvelo.fr in the actions\r\nAdd a link to <a href=\"https://mesaidesvelo.fr/\">mesaidesvelo.fr</a> in the relevant actions.

Cycling makes an appearance in the simulator, and in the \"go to work other than by car\" action, which replaces \"go to work by public transit\". Walking 🚶♀️ and other modes are not left out obviously 🛴.\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-02-08 15-42-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/107234732-4097f700-6a24-11eb-9f54-ff64cf66183f.png)\r\n\r\nWe let you guess the impact that this quesiton has on the results ;) \r\n\r\nWe have also improved the input guides (e.g. number of houses: is it with or without me?)\r\n\r\n🤳 The phone question has been revised, now that all recent phones are larger than 5 inches, and to take into account the 'no smartphone' option.\r\n\r\n🔥🌲 The heating in steres of wood question becomes more relevant: it's counted in steres, not kWh. We will continue to improve the other entries soon (wood in pellets, fuel oil).\r\n\r\n## Other improvements \r\n\r\nNew features (like this one you are reading) now appear directly on https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveautés, it is still more accessible than <a href=\"https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/releases\">on github</a> 🙂 \r\n\r\n\r\n🐛 Several quite important bugs have been solved thanks to your feedback (simulation end always at 11 tons, default value input -> no \"next\" button, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Our roadmap\r\n\r\nNow that the \"issues\" onget is clearer, it was time to put our roadmap on the simulator / calculation model side, it's in the <a href=\"https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-data/projects/1\">\"Projects\" section</a>. Everything is indicative, but it allows you to know what our current topics are \r\n\r\n> As for the interface, it is rather <a href=\"https://github.com/betagouv/ecolab-climat/milestones\">here</a> that you should go to follow the progress.",

Indeed, we have many (many) feedbacks, often similar.\r\n\r\n- we improved the car questions 🚗, especially to avoid talking about \"your\" car when the user said he didn't have one\r\n\r\n- the 🚗 emoji was not suitable to represent the transportation category, leading some people who use only a little car, but other means of transportation to believe a bug in our model. It is now this one: 🚦\r\n",

Nos Gestes Climat is now available in English 💂\r\n\r\n![Recording 2022-11-09 at 18 52 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/200904084-6051257b-e0ce-4483-8d91-05b5bbd44e0b.gif)\r\n\r\nOf course, translation is a long-term task, so if you find a problem, we have a page dedicated to feedback \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/200904709-d6a19333-9c70-4033-bb15-bafde6661794.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon, it will also be possible to calculate your climate footprint in Spanish, Italian and other languages \r\n\r\n> Beware, translation is not internationalization of the model: for the moment, there are only two calculation models, Metropolitan France and Guadeloupe. The others are coming soon!\r\n\r\n## Brand new figures for the food footprint\r\n\r\nWe have improved the footprints of lunch and dinner dishes \r\n\r\nFirst, we have improved the calculation of the emission factor of the most important component of the meals, meat and fish. Instead of a simple average, we now do a weighted average by national consumption (e.g. for the dish \"meat 1\", pork and chicken are no longer equally important) \r\n\r\nSecondly, there was a global update of agribalysis in October, which corrected overestimated emission factors. We have updated our figures with these \r\n\r\n <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat/pull/1525\">More info</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/alimentation/plats/viande-1\">![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/200906087-5748cab9-d053-48dd-b169-3038dcf50fa2.png)</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Navigation improvement during and after the test\r\n\r\nIt is <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/677\">now easier</a> to navigate through the categories and answers already given after the test \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/193876373-fd942951-afb3-40ec-8316-480b9bdf7241.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/193876420-5203196f-54af-42fb-b61b-9e2822da9a59.png)\r\n\r\nIn the same way, a new button `Find my simulation` appears on the home page, and the test progress in % on the profile page. <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/pull/672\">More info</a>.\r\n\r\n## A new page to explain our fossil dependency\r\n\r\nA <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/pétrole-et-gaz\">new page</a> to explain the stakes of reducing our oil and gas consumption. Indeed, climate is only one of them, and we are going through a period where inflation and geopolitical tensions are more and more integrated in the equation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/200906228-cb2db1ba-3083-48eb-9a96-26f0fb02daf1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We've redesigned it entirely, making it more like a mini-game where the goal is to reduce your footprint \r\n\r\n![ngc-action-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139829768-5759d428-1e0d-4c7d-9fd3-682dbebb1b90.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is just the beginning: we already have <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/359\">next steps</a> planned to make engagement even easier.\r\n\r\nWe are also introducing *personas*: typical profiles that you can select to experience the action path as a given citizen \r\n\r\n## Menu 🐟️\r\n\r\nWe've received dozens of requests to include a fish menu on the diet choice screen. There are now 2 of them! \r\n\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-11-02 11-29-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830102-bd7cee54-c1fd-454c-8eb0-7ce2a750ffa8.png)\r\n\r\nThese new dishes have been made from the <a href=\"https://agribalyse.fr/\">Agribalyse</a> database, and the calculation is of course *open*. Many new food items will follow \r\n\r\n## A new menu for the application \r\n\r\nNosgestesclimat is designed to be used on mobile as on desktop. The mobile version now has a permanent menu at the bottom of the screen, and the desktop version of a new arrangement in two columns, with a menu also present on the left \r\n\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-11-02 11-31-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830463-203c8896-0eda-49ad-ba45-be1a19e180de.png)\r\n\r\nThis new menu makes the application more accessible, and it's just one of many accessibility improvements we have <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/350\">planned</a>.\r\n\r\n## The French average is now 9 tons! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this does not reflect unexpected efforts, but an improvement in the calculation method of the Ministry of the Environment \r\n\r\nThe good news is that the French administration is taking the subject seriously, improving its calculations and explaining the differences in a scientific way \r\n\r\nDetailed explanations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maeool/status/1453282887583866885\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nSo why do we show an average of 9.8 tons in the simulator? Because our calculation is made using another method than the government one, complementary. More info <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/issues/365#issuecomment-957321261\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conference mode improvements 🏟️\r\n\r\nThis collective mode of using ourgestesclimate is more and more used. To facilitate the sharing of the link at the beginning of the conference, we generate a great QRCode that you just have to project or send by mail\r\n![Capture d’écran du 2021-11-02 11-32-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/139830597-63fe1856-5622-4c52-b7f4-23ccbfaa6bd9.png) \r\n\r\nAnother improvement, we exclude from the group results the simulations that resulted in a too high footprint, above 100 tons. This limit will be configurable soon \r\n\r\n## Technical improvements 🐇\r\n\r\nWe continue to make the site lighter, removing a graphic animation library (react-spring) and better cutting out the conference mode from the rest of the application \r\n\r\nOf course, many reported bugs have also been fixed.",

    "body": "it is in the National Assembly in the 7th district of Paris that the State budget is voted each year](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/205978955-88a0ad61-244c-4afb-89a9-600eef3a5f1c.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you have ever done a carbon footprint test, you may have noticed a rather surprising category: public services. About 1 ton out of the French average of 10 tons, it may not seem like much... However, for those who adopt a rather low-carbon lifestyle, and more generally in relation to the objective of 2 tons of individual footprint (remember that the important thing is not the objective but the <a href=\"https://datagir.ademe.fr/blog/budget-empreinte-carbone-c-est-quoi/\">transition scenario</a>), 1 ton can legitimately look like an elephant in the room! \r\n\r\nIn this article, we tell you all about this famous \"public services\" or now \"societal services\" item in UCS: how it is calculated, what it is composed of, and how we just used these numbers to make a **✨ new version of the calculation model of nosgestesclimat.fr** \r\n\r\n## The average French person emits 8.9 tons (November 2022)\r\n\r\nFrance, like many other countries, has set commitments to reduce its climate footprint \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we obviously need to know *where we are* today and how it evolves each year \r\n\r\nThis is the task of the Ministry of Ecology's <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/\">Data and Statistical Studies Department</a>, which <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286\">estimates it at 8.9 tons per person in 2021</a> \r\n\r\nHow is this figure calculated? The explanation of the calculation is <a href=\"https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/files/9980633/methodologie_empreinte_carbone_octobre2021_0.pdf\">transparent but relatively difficult to understand</a>, so we will simply explain the principle of this clever calculation \r\n\r\nBasically, to calculate a climate footprint, you have to start from a physical reality. We have to calculate the real greenhouse gas emissions (well, estimate it) of a concrete action: for example, we know that burning 1 liter of gasoline in a car emits about <a href=\"https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/transport/voiture/thermique/empreinte-au-litre\">2.7 kg of CO2</a>. Then we can count the liters of diesel burned by French semi-trailers, by barges on rivers, by ships, planes, etc \r\n\r\nThe problem then, is to calculate the footprint of other sectors, which do not directly burn these fossil fuels. For example, a hospital buys wooden furniture but does not manufacture or transport it itself. The furniture is cut up in a factory, which bought it. For this, a truck delivered wooden boards to them. This wood has been treated by the chemical industry, and produced by the forestry industry (the management of forest wood), which uses diesel chainsaws, etc \r\n\r\nThe administration does not have a precise description of all these transactions (kg of wood, volume of oil and paint, etc.), but it does have the exchanges in € between all these sectors, at an aggregated level over the year, called macro. Thanks to these monetary exchanges, a matrix calculation allows to attribute to each sector the carbon footprint of its added value!\r\n\r\nThese calculations are made periodically. The latest accurate version is for the year 2017, and the latest (less accurate) estimate is for 2021 \r\n\r\n## Define the perimeter of a base attributed to each French company\r\n\r\nBy summing up the footprint of all these sectors, divided by the population of the country, this gives <a href=\"https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/empreinte-SDES?PR=1584\">the</a> \"macro\" <a href=\"https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/empreinte-SDES?PR=1584\">footprint</a> per person \r\n\r\nIn parallel, the calculation model of nosgestesclimat is a compilation of models called \"micro\": you are asked a multitude of questions to reconstitute *your carbon footprint* from physical data of consumption.\r\n\r\n> These are two perspectives on the same physical reality, two very different methods producing two figures, which fortunately converge around 9 tons of CO2e \r\n\r\nThese two methods are very different, but they are also complementary: indeed, the analysis by consumption cannot capture all the emissions of a French person. If the micro method of nosgestesclimat allows to easily calculate the footprint of your car kilometers, it is unable to estimate the footprint of public services that you use in a diffuse way all year long, as well as commercial services such as the fiber and mobile internet network that most of the population benefits from in a latent way (admittedly in a variable way). We therefore need to adopt a hybrid model that mixes micro and macro.\r\n\r\n> The header photo of this article illustrates the problem: it is easy to estimate the climate footprint of the truck, the car and the motorcycle. But what about the footprint of this regularly re-bituminized road? What about the maintenance of the road signs? What about the footprint of the operation of the national assembly itself? \r\n\r\nThe objective is then to define the perimeter of these complementary worlds in order to avoid double counting, and thus to obtain the final value of the constant societal services, the sum of public services and commercial services, attributed to each French person.\r\n\r\n![Recording 2022-12-12 at 18 08 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/207108876-1334c2b0-8275-43d5-a899-81d04c2230d9.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## A first calculation\r\n\r\nWe therefore analyzed the macro footprint data <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/la-decomposition-de-lempreinte-carbone-de-la-demande-finale-de-la-france-par-postes-de-consommation\">shared by the SDES</a>, sector by sector, line by line, to include a share, from 0 to 100%, of the societal services footprint \r\n\r\n> It should be remembered that the objective is always to \"obtain orders of magnitude\": it is not a question of claiming a result to the nearest 10 kg of CO2. In this respect, it should be remembered that our climate objectives target a 90% reduction in our footprint \r\n\r\nThe line \"Public administration and defense\" is obviously included in the public services: the citizen has no influence on these governmental positions other than through his vote and his public commitment \r\n\r\nThings get more complicated for example for the item \"🏗️ construction\": it includes many diverse activities benefiting the whole society, yet we do not have the details of their carbon footprint. An allocation is therefore made on the basis of the turnover of the sub-branches and sub-sub-branches <a href=\"https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092\">published by INSEE</a>, these are the % that you can see appearing in our documentation \r\n\r<details>\n\r\n\r\n<summary><i>Learn more about the breakdown by turnover of the SDES carbon data</i></summary>\r\n\r\n> The data provided by the SDES gives a carbon footprint corresponding to what is consumed on the French territory by economic branch (e.g.: E36 = water distribution network = 677 kTCO2e) or by group of economic branches (e.g.: F41_43 = Construction = 54116 kTCO2e) For this data, there is a first level of aggregation that we have chosen to disaggregate according to the share of turnover <a href=\"https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4226067?sommaire=4226092\">of the branch</a> in the grouping proposed by the SDES (e.g.: for F41_43, we have F41=25%, F42=13.5%, F43=61.5%)\r\n&gt\r\n> Some of the data are secret, so we assumed that these data were also secret for the calculation of the national carbon footprint. In the absence of additional information, we have chosen not to consider them in these decomposition calculations.\r\n&gt\r\n> To go even further, we sometimes needed a higher level of precision by looking at the economic sub-branches. Indeed, if we take the example of E38 relating to waste collection, only sub-branches E3812 and E3822, concerning hazardous waste, were to be included in the utilities. We have therefore also used the breakdown by turnover to highlight the carbon intensity associated with the sub-branches in question within E38.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\nFor market services, we have tried to include in the baseline footprint those consumptions that are relatively universal (e.g., everyone has to buy home insurance) or those that are not yet captured by our micro models (e.g., consumption of telecom services) but may be in the future \r\n\r\nIf you are interested, you can explore our documentation that explains and justifies this allocation via the <a href=\"https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/services-publics?PR=1584\">utilities</a> and <a href=\"https://base--nosgestesclimat.netlify.app/documentation/services-marchands?PR=1584\">market</a> services pages. It is quite \"expert\", we did our best for a first version, your feedback will be valuable.\r\n\r\n## The result\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of our hybrid model \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177762/207576758-03cfbc96-a6a2-4817-a4cb-4c4562342783.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n⚠️ Beware, do not see in this graph a reliable average value of the climate footprint of a French person, <a href=\"https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/lempreinte-carbone-de-la-france-de-1995-2021?rubrique=27&dossier=1286\">contrary to the SDES figure of 8.9t</a>, but simply the anatomy of our hybrid calculation model. The values are likely to change regularly, in full transparency \r\n\r\nThe objective of Nos Gestes Climat remains to estimate the footprint associated with the lifestyle of a real person. By the way, the objective of the next versions is precisely to cover many items that are currently left out 🐕️⛴️🛵⚡️🏡. See you soon! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
